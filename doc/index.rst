Biboumi – XMPP gateway to IRC
=============================

Homepage: https://biboumi.louiz.org

Forge: https://lab.louiz.org/louiz/biboumi

Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and translates
between the two protocols. It can be used to access IRC channels using any
XMPP client as if these channels were XMPP MUCs.
