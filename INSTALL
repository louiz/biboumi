  Configure
==============

Configure the build system using cmake, there are many solutions to do
  that, the simplest is to just run

% cmake .

in the current directory

You can also configure many parameters of the build (like personnalize
CFLAGS, the install path, choose the compiler, or enabling some options
like the POLLER to use), using:

% ccmake .

In ccmake, first use 'c' to configure the build system, edit the values you
need and finaly use 'g' to generate the Makefiles to build the system and
quit ccmake.

or

% cmake -i .

and respond to the questions when you are prompted to.

You can select the poller used by biboumi, at compile-time, using the POLLER
cmake option.  Available values are:
 POLL: use the standard poll(2). This is the default value because it works on all supported plateforms
 EPOLL: use the Linux-specific epoll(7)

Example, configure the poller with cmake:
% cmake . -DPOLLER=EPOLL
