Description: XMPP gateway to connect to IRC servers
 Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and translates
 between the two protocols. It can be used to access IRC channels using
 any XMPP client as if these channels were XMPP MUCs.
 .
 It is written in modern C++14 and makes great efforts to have as little
 dependencies and to be as simple as possible.
 .
 The goal is to provide a way to access most of IRC features using any
 XMPP client.  It doesn’t however try to provide a complete mapping of
 the features of both worlds simply because this is not useful and most
 probably impossible.  For example all IRC modes are not all
 translatable into an XMPP features.  Some of them are (like +m (mute)
 or +o (operator) modes), but some others are IRC-specific.  If IRC is
 the limiting factor (for example you cannot have a non-ASCII nickname
 on IRC) then biboumi doesn’t try to work around this issue: it just
 enforces the rules of the IRC server by telling the user that he/she
 must choose an ASCII-only nickname.  An important goal is to keep the
 software (and its code) light and simple.
